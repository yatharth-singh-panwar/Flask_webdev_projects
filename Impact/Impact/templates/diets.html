    <h1>Types of Diets - How They Work and Pros & Cons</h1>
    <p>Diet culture feels more ubiquitous than ever before. Gone are the days where most folks would grab a hard roll, slather on some butter, and get on with their lives. Now, there’s a seemingly endless number of ways one can eat to lose weight, gain muscle, boost focus, and feel healthier in general. And a lot of people are following different diets.</p>

    <p>It’s estimated that 45 million people go on a diet each year, and Grand View Research claims that the weight management market is valued at $288 billion in 2020. Searching for diet advice online can be exhaustive, and it may lead you to unreliable sources. By having a better understanding of the most common types of diets, you can decide which one works best for your lifestyle and overall goals (whether that’s to slim down, bulk up, or be healthier).</p>

    <p><strong>A Word About Diets:</strong> Before diving into these diets, it's important to note that no single diet is a universal solution for everyone's health needs. Weight loss is primarily about maintaining a caloric deficit, and the quality of food is as important as macronutrient ratios. Some diets may lead to deficiencies in vital micronutrients, so it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional.</p>

    <p>Remember that individual preferences, health conditions, and goals should guide your choice of diet. Always prioritize your overall well-being and consult with a healthcare professional before making significant dietary changes.</p>
